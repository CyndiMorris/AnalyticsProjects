# Project: Practical Statistics - Probability, A/B Testing, Regression 

## Project Details
This project utilizes Probability theory, A/B Testing, and Regression analysis to evaluate the impact of a new e-commerce webpage design on user conversions compared to an existing version. The aim is to ascertain whether the proposed changes yield a significant improvement in conversion rates and to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

Skills demonstrated in this project include:

* Proficiency in probability theory, A/B testing, and regression analysis  
* Formulating hypotheses and conducting hypothesis testing  
* Data wrangling and manipulation using Pandas  
* Statistical modeling and interpretation using statsmodels  
* Visualization of analysis results using Matplotlib  


## Analysis and Statistics




### Statistical and Analytical techniques used:

**Descriptive Statistics:**  
Calculating key metrics such as mean, median, and standard deviation to summarize conversion rates, page views, and user demographics.
Employing probability theory to analyze the likelihood of events occurring and to make informed predictions about user behavior.

**Probability:**  
Employing probability theory to analyze the likelihood of events occurring and to make informed predictions about user behavior.  

**A/B Testing:**  
Conducting A/B tests to compare the performance of different webpage designs and determine their impact on user conversions.

**Regression Analysis:**  
Performing regression analysis to investigate the relationship between variables and predict conversion outcomes based on factors such as webpage type and user demographics.

**Data Visualization:**  
Utilizing various visualizations including histograms, scatter plots, and box plots to graphically present the data and elucidate distributions and relationships between variables.
