# Project: Practical Statistics - Probability, A/B Testing, Regression 

## Project Details
This project utilizes Probability theory, A/B Testing, and Regression analysis to evaluate the impact of a new e-commerce webpage design on user conversions compared to an existing version. The aim is to ascertain whether the proposed changes yield a significant improvement in conversion rates and to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

Skills demonstrated in this project include:

* Proficiency in the steps of a typical data analysis process
* Formulating and answering dataset-related inquiries
* Wrangling data into a usable format for thorough investigation
* Effective communication of analysis results
* Optimization of data analysis through vectorized operations in NumPy and Pandas
* Accessing data conveniently using Pandas' Series and DataFrame objects
* Generating illustrative plots with Matplotlib to showcase analysis findings.

## Analysis and Statistics




### Statistical and Analytical techniques used:

**Descriptive Statistics:**   
Descriptive statistics, such as counts, percentages, and averages, were calculated to summarize key metrics, including the total number of appointments, the number of no-shows, and the distribution of appointments across weekdays.

**Data Visualization:**   
Visualizations, including bar charts, pie charts, and stacked bar charts, were utilized to present the findings visually and facilitate the interpretation of trends and patterns in the data.

**Comparative Analysis:**   
Comparative analysis was conducted to compare the proportion of no-shows among different weekdays and between patients who received SMS reminders and those who did not. This involved calculating percentages and conducting statistical tests to determine significant differences.

**Correlation Analysis:**   
Correlation analysis was performed to assess the relationship between receiving SMS reminders and appointment attendance. This involved examining the correlation coefficient and conducting hypothesis testing to determine the strength and significance of the association.

**Summarization Techniques:**   
Techniques such as summarizing weekday statistics and calculating percentages were used to provide a comprehensive overview of appointment no-show patterns and the effectiveness of SMS reminders.
