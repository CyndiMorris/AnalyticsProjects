# Project: Finding Donors for CharityML - Supervised Learnnig

## Project Overview
In this project, I used sklearn and supervised learning techniques on data collected from the U.S. census to help a fictitious charity organization identify people most likely to donate to their cause. 

Frist, I investigated the factors that affect the likelihood of charity donations being made. Then, I used a training and predicting pipeline to evaluate the accuracy and efficiency/speed of three supervised machine learning algorithms (names). I then proceed to fine tune the parameters of the algorithm that provides the highest donation yield. Finally, I also explored the impact of reducing number of features in data.

## Project Highlights
This project is designed to become acquainted with the many supervised learning algorithms available in sklearn, and to also provide for a method of evaluating just how each model works and performs on a certain type of data. It is important in machine learning to understand exactly when and where a certain algorithm should be used, and when one should be avoided.

Things learned by completing this project:
- How to identify when preprocessing is needed, and how to apply it.
- How to establish a benchmark for a solution to the problem.
- What each of several supervised learning algorithms accomplishes given a specific dataset.
- How to investigate whether a candidate solution model is adequate for the problem.

## Software Requirements

This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

- [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

[Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

## Starting the Project

The `finding_donors` folder contains the necessary project files on [Machine Learning projects GitHub](https://github.com/udacity/machine-learning), under the `projects` folder. The files for projects can be directly downloaded from this repo. Please make sure to use the most recent version of project files when completing the project!

This project contains three files:

- `finding_donors.ipynb`: This is the main file where work for the project will be performed.
- `census.csv`: The project's dataset that will need to be loaded into the notebook.
- `visuals.py`: A Python file containing visualization code that is run behind-the-scenes. Do not modify
