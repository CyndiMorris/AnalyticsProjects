# Project: Finding Donors for CharityML - Supervised Learnnig

## Project Overview
Supervised learning techniques and an analytical mind will need to be applied to data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) identify people most likely to donate to their cause. The data will be explored to learn how the census data is recorded and a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques will be applied to manipulate the data into a workable format. 

The analyst will then evaluate several supervised learners of their choice on the data, and consider which is best suited for the solution. Afterwards, the selected model will be optimized and presented as the solution to CharityML. Finally, the chosen model and its predictions under the hood will be explored, to see just how well it's performing when considering the data it's given predicted selling price to your statistics.

## Project Highlights
This project is designed to become acquainted with the many supervised learning algorithms available in sklearn, and to also provide for a method of evaluating just how each model works and performs on a certain type of data. It is important in machine learning to understand exactly when and where a certain algorithm should be used, and when one should be avoided.

Things learn by completing this project:
- How to identify when preprocessing is needed, and how to apply it.
- How to establish a benchmark for a solution to the problem.
- What each of several supervised learning algorithms accomplishes given a specific dataset.
- How to investigate whether a candidate solution model is adequate for the problem.

## Software Requirements

This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

- [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

[Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

## Starting the Project

The `finding_donors` folder contains the necessary project files on [Machine Learning projects GitHub](https://github.com/udacity/machine-learning), under the `projects` folder. The files for projects can be directly downloaded from this repo. Please make sure to use the most recent version of project files when completing the project!

This project contains three files:

- `finding_donors.ipynb`: This is the main file where work for the project will be performed.
- `census.csv`: The project's dataset that will need to be loaded into the notebook.
- `visuals.py`: A Python file containing visualization code that is run behind-the-scenes. Do not modify

A **README** file has also been provided with the project files which may contain additional necessary information or instruction for the project. 

## Submitting the Project

### Evaluation
Your project will be reviewed by a Udacity reviewer against the **<a href="https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/406/view" target="_blank">Finding Donors for CharityML project rubric</a>**. Be sure to review this rubric thoroughly and self-evaluate your project before submission. All criteria found in the rubric must be *meeting specifications* for you to pass.

### Submission Files
When you are ready to submit your project, collect the following files and compress them into a single archive for upload. Alternatively, you may supply the following files on your GitHub Repo in a folder named `student_intervention` for ease of access:
 - The `finding_donors.ipynb` notebook file with all questions answered and all code cells executed and displaying output.
 - An **HTML** export of the project notebook with the name **report.html**. This file *must* be present for your project to be evaluated.

Once you have collected these files and reviewed the project rubric, proceed to the project submission page.

### I'm Ready!
When you're ready to submit your project, click on the **Submit Project** button at the bottom of the page.

If you are having any problems submitting your project or wish to check on the status of your submission, please email us at **machine-support@udacity.com** or visit us in the <a href="http://discussions.udacity.com" target="_blank">discussion forums</a>.

### What's Next?
You will get an email as soon as your reviewer has feedback for you. In the meantime, review your next project and feel free to get started on it or the courses supporting it!
