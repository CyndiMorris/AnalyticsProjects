# Project: Finding Donors for CharityML - Supervised Learning

## Project Details
The [Finding Donors for CharityML](https://github.com/CyndiMorris/AnalyticsProjects/blob/main/FindingDonors/FindingDonors.ipynb) project is designed to become acquainted with the many supervised learning algorithms available in sklearn, and to also provide for a method of evaluating just how each model works and performs on a certain type of data. It is important in machine learning to understand exactly when and where a certain algorithm should be used, and when one should be avoided.

Things learned by completing this project:
- How to identify when preprocessing is needed, and how to apply it.
- How to establish a benchmark for a solution to the problem.
- What each of several supervised learning algorithms accomplishes given a specific dataset.
- How to investigate whether a candidate solution model is adequate for the problem.

## Analysis and Statistics

Supervised Learning Models  
* Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)  
* Decision Trees  
* Ensemble Methods (Bagging, AdaBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)  
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNeighbors)  
* Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier (SGDC)  
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
* Logistic Regression

Steps performed:
1. Investigated the factors influencing charitable donation likelihood.
2. Established a training and prediction pipeline to evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of three supervised machine learning algorithms: Gradient Boosting Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
3. Fine-tuned the parameters of the algorithm that generated the highest donation yield.
4. Explored the impact of reducing the number of features in the dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset was collected from the U.S. census to help a fictitious charity organization identify people most likely to donate to their cause. 

## Software and Packages

Python  
NumPy   
Pandas  
Scikit-learn
